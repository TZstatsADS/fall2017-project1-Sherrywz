### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Text Mining Analysis of Presidential Inaugural Speeches
+ This project is conducted by [Xiaoyu Zhou]

+ Project summary: Inaugutal speeches are the beginning of presidency for each American president. It captures the sentiment of the time, and reflects the president's advocacy and his intended policies during his tenure. We can transform these speeches to quantified results by text mining analysis, to explore the unique characteristics or different aspects among them.

Sentiment analysis and topic modeling are two basic and major methods in text mining analysis. This time we basically use these two methods to conduct the project. The project will roughly explain four questions we interested:     
1) By applying Wordcloud method,could we see some connections between the president's speech and condition of era backgrounds?  
2) As time goes by, how the sentences length and the speeches length would change?   
3) How the president's sentiment would change during a speech? Who is the most sentimental president?   
4) If there are obvious differences of the topic selection between Republican Party and Democratic Party?
